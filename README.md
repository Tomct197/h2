This is an individual assignment, and must be completed without assistance from other students or external persons. You are welcome to use online resources without other limitations.

Commit and push your changes regularly. This is especially important with homework tasks, as the contents of changes, timestamps, and commit messages will be used in part to verify independence of solutions. Git usage may account for up to 50% of your grade.

Your completed code must be pushed to Gitlab at or before the 0900 NZDT on the 20th of December 2022. Late submissions will not be considered without prior arrangement.
